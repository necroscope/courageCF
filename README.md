pulsating therapy unit hack

Looking for a hack to stop the pulsating therapy unit from beeping.  The beep is annoying and scary.  There
seems to be no need for it.

Download the code and at the windows command prompt type:

cscript beep.vbs

To see what we mean.


We are looking for people who can reverse engineer the The inCourageâ„¢ System Model ICS-1M-US
to stop it from beeping.  Software or hardware mods are welcome.

Once we complete this hack the next hack will look for ways to export the usage data of
the device.
